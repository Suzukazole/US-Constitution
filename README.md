This is the repo for the course project in CS F214: Logic in Computer Science, Fall 2021.

## Guidelines

**Main branch shall only contain approved changes, do not push directly to it!**

- Create a branch on your local machine for each section of an article.
- You can have multiple branches when you want to work on different sections at the same time.
- Comment out every functor's description at the start of each section. 
- Send PR for your branch once you start, you can keep adding commits to it later.
- Once everyone agrees, PRs will get merged(in order of sections).
